Hi, I'm Michael! Passionate about leveraging data-driven insights for business growth, I'm currently honing my skills in data analytics. As a soon-to-be Data Analytics certificate holder, I'm eager to transition into a Data Analyst role, building upon my background in entrepreneurship.

### Create Database & Table Information
**Code:** [Create Database & Table information](Project1_MichaelRomm.sql)

**Goal:** Setting up a SQL database for managing sales data efficiently.

**Description:** This project involves creating a SQL database named "Sales" and defining multiple tables to store sales-related information. The schema is based on AdventureWorks2017, with adjustments and additional constraints applied. Each table, such as SalesTerritory, CreditCard, Address, ShipMethod, CurrencyRate, SpecialOfferProduct, Customer, SalesPerson, SalesOrderHeader, and SalesOrderDetail, is designed to capture specific aspects of sales transactions, customer details, and product information. Constraints, both at the column and table levels, ensure data integrity and consistency. The order of commands for table creation and data insertion is meticulously arranged to handle foreign key dependencies and maintain referential integrity.

**Skills:** SQL database design, schema creation, data modeling, constraint management, data insertion.

**Technology:** SQL Server.

**Results:** The database schema and tables are created successfully, providing a robust foundation for managing sales data effectively. The project demonstrates proficiency in SQL database design and management, ensuring scalability, performance, and data integrity in handling sales-related information.
